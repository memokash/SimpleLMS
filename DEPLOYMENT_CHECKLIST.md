# Deployment Readiness Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Security & Dependencies
- [x] Attempted to fix npm vulnerabilities (18 remain - need manual review)
- [x] Created production-safe logger utility (`lib/logger.ts`)
- [x] Replaced critical console.log statements with logger in Firebase, Stripe, and Claude modules
- [x] Moved Stripe price IDs to environment variables

### 2. Configuration
- [x] Created `.env.example` file with all required environment variables
- [x] Added Stripe price IDs to Next.js config environment pass-through
- [x] Configured security headers in `next.config.js`

### 3. Error Monitoring
- [x] Installed and configured Sentry for error tracking
- [x] Created Sentry configuration files (client, server, edge)
- [x] Integrated Sentry with logger utility for production error reporting

### 4. Build Verification
- [x] TypeScript check passes without errors
- [x] Production build completes successfully
- [x] Bundle sizes are reasonable (87.3 kB shared JS)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### Critical (Fix Before Production)
1. **NPM Vulnerabilities (18 total)**
   - 4 Critical (protobufjs in firebase-admin, undici in firebase)
   - 4 High (axios in @sendgrid/mail, xlsx)
   - Consider alternatives or wait for patches

2. **Console Logs (562 occurrences in 69 files)**
   - Major cleanup still needed across components
   - Use the logger utility instead

3. **Firebase Email Authentication**
   - Verify Firebase Auth is properly configured in Firebase Console
   - Ensure email/password authentication is enabled
   - Check CORS settings for production domain

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID
STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID

# AI Services
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY

# Email
SENDGRID_API_KEY
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL

# Monitoring (Optional but recommended)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN

# App Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=false
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **Set all environment variables in production hosting**
2. **Configure Firebase Security Rules**
3. **Set up Stripe webhooks for production**
4. **Configure custom domain and SSL**
5. **Set up monitoring alerts in Sentry**
6. **Enable Firebase App Check for additional security**
7. **Review and update CORS settings**
8. **Set up automated backups for Firestore**

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## üìä Monitoring Post-Deployment

- Monitor Sentry for errors
- Check Firebase usage and quotas
- Monitor Stripe webhook events
- Review server logs for any issues
- Track performance metrics

## Risk Assessment: **MEDIUM**

The application is mostly ready for deployment but requires:
1. Resolution of critical npm vulnerabilities
2. Cleanup of console.log statements
3. Verification of Firebase email authentication setup

Once these issues are addressed, the application will be ready for production deployment.
