# HIPAA Compliance Documentation - SimpleLMS

## Overview
SimpleLMS is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind for medical education environments. This document outlines the measures taken to ensure Protected Health Information (PHI) is properly handled.

## Data Classification

### Non-PHI Educational Data (What we store)
- ✅ **Educational Profiles**: Medical status (student/resident/attending), rotation information, institution
- ✅ **Learning Progress**: Quiz scores, completion rates, study analytics
- ✅ **Academic Information**: Course enrollment, educational preferences
- ✅ **Professional Development**: Career stage, specialization interests

### PHI Data (What we DO NOT store)
- ❌ **Patient Information**: No patient data, cases are de-identified
- ❌ **Clinical Records**: No actual medical records or patient charts
- ❌ **Personal Health Data**: No personal medical history of users
- ❌ **Diagnostic Information**: No actual diagnostic codes or treatment plans

## Technical Safeguards

### Data Encryption
- ✅ **In Transit**: All data encrypted using HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- ✅ **At Rest**: Firebase Firestore provides automatic encryption
- ✅ **API Communications**: All API calls use encrypted connections

### Access Controls
- ✅ **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with multi-factor authentication support
- ✅ **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ **User Permissions**: Granular privacy settings for profile visibility

```typescript
// Privacy controls implemented
interface PrivacySettings {
  showEmail: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showPhone: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showLocation: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showRotation: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showRotationLocation: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showInstitution: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
  showStatus: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private';
}
```

### Database Security
- ✅ **Firestore Rules**: Strict access controls implemented
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Firebase provides comprehensive audit trails

## Administrative Safeguards

### Data Minimization
- ✅ **Limited Collection**: Only collect data necessary for educational purposes
- ✅ **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for medical education and career development
- ✅ **Retention Policy**: Automatic data cleanup after user account deletion

### User Rights
- ✅ **Access**: Users can view all their stored data
- ✅ **Rectification**: Users can update/correct their information
- ✅ **Deletion**: Account deletion removes all associated data
- ✅ **Portability**: Export functionality for user data

### Staff Training
- ✅ **Privacy Awareness**: Development team trained on privacy principles
- ✅ **Security Protocols**: Secure development lifecycle practices
- ✅ **Incident Response**: Procedures for handling security incidents

## Physical Safeguards

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ **Cloud Provider**: Google Cloud Platform (HIPAA compliant infrastructure)
- ✅ **Data Centers**: SOC 2 Type II certified facilities
- ✅ **Redundancy**: Multi-region backup and disaster recovery

## Business Associate Agreements

### Third-Party Services
- ✅ **Google/Firebase**: HIPAA compliant cloud services with BAA
- ✅ **Stripe**: Payment processing with privacy protection
- ✅ **Vercel**: Hosting with security and compliance features

## Educational Use Case Compliance

### De-identified Content
- ✅ **Case Studies**: All medical cases are de-identified
- ✅ **Quiz Content**: No real patient information in questions
- ✅ **Educational Materials**: Hypothetical scenarios only

### Appropriate Use
- ✅ **Academic Purpose**: Platform designed for education, not clinical use
- ✅ **Professional Development**: Career advancement and knowledge building
- ✅ **Peer Learning**: Secure colleague networking for educational purposes

## Security Measures Implemented

### Input Validation & Sanitization
```typescript
// Example security measures in API routes
if (!priceId || typeof priceId !== 'string' || priceId.length < 5) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Valid Price ID is required' }, { status: 400 });
}

// Content filtering for AI prompts
const maliciousPatterns = ['ignore previous instructions', 'jailbreak', 'override system'];
if (maliciousPatterns.some(pattern => lowercasePrompt.includes(pattern))) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid prompt content' }, { status: 400 });
}
```

### Security Headers
```javascript
// Production security headers
headers: [
  { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'origin-when-cross-origin' },
  { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()' }
]
```
