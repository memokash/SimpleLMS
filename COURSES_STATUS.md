# SimpleLMS Courses Status Report

## ‚úÖ Firebase Database Status

### Courses Collection
- **Total Courses:** 1,746 quizzes successfully loaded in Firebase
- **Collection:** `courses`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Accessible and working

### Sample Courses Available:

3. MSQ-299: Dermatology Conditions for USMLE and COMLEX
4. MSQ0-2: Development of the Central Nervous System
5. MSQ000-0: Renal Implications of Common Medications

### Course Structure in Firebase:
```javascript
{
  // Current fields in database:
  NewTitle: "MSQ Quiz 4: Mastering Cytokines...",
  CourseName: "Comprehensive Study of Cytokines...",
  BriefDescription: "Explore the pivotal roles...",
  OriginalQuizTitle: "(MSQ Quiz 4) Cytokines..."
  // Note: Category field is empty - needs AI categorization
}
```

### Questions Subcollection:
- Each course has a `questions` subcollection
- Questions use Excel-like format: "Option (a)", "Option (b)", etc.
- Answer stored as letter: "a", "b", "c", etc.

## üîß Component Configuration

### CoursesDashboardOptimized.tsx
- **Fixed:** Now directly loads from Firebase (removed mock data)
- **Fixed:** Navigation to quiz page (`/quiz?id={courseId}`)
- **Fixed:** Shows actual course count (1,746 quizzes)
- **Items per page:** 50 (to show more courses at once)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

### 1. Categories Not Set
- All 1,746 courses are "Uncategorized"
- OpenAI categorization service exists but hasn't been run
- Categories need to be extracted from question content

### 2. Field Naming Mismatch
- Firebase uses: `NewTitle`, `CourseName`, `BriefDescription`
- Code expects: `title`, `courseName`, `description`
- CourseService handles this mapping

### 3. Question Format
- Questions use Excel format ("Option (a)", "Option (b)")
- Answers are letters ("a", "b") instead of indices (0, 1)
- QuizApp component needs to handle this format

1. Navigate to the courses dashboard
2. You'll see the 1,746 available quizzes

The SimpleLMS application has **1,746 medical quizzes** successfully loaded in Firebase and accessible through the CoursesDashboardOptimized component. Users can now:
- Browse all available quizzes
- Search and filter content
